Description: This package takes chromsome conformation capture data as input
    and annotates each genomic region with segmentation data from StateHub
    (http://statehub.org/statehub/). This data can then be annotated with
    the nearest gene and using RNA-seq data, expression values can be linked to
    each gene. Moreover, these data can be combined into a circle plot with 
    heatmaps showing average score of chromsome conformation capture 
    interaction between segmentation marks as well as average FPKM values for
    genes in each type of interaction.
